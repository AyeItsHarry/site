### Welcome to my site!
Hi everyone! My name is Harry, I'm 16, and I'm a college student. Currently, I'm studying Maths, Physics and Computer Science. In my free time, I try my best to contribute to open source projects, and help people out in the WiiLink Discord server. You can contact me via [email](mailto:me@harrywalker.uk), or on Discord (@ayeitsharry), my DMs are open!
