Hello people of the internet! My name is Harry Walker, and I've setup this blog with the Jekyll Minimal Mistakes theme to just talk about whatever I feel like. The site is fully open source, and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ayeitsharry/site) on my GitHub. I'm not quite sure what this site will be used for, but subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml) so you won't miss a thing!
